Hello, this is just a bit of text to test whether maths works within the markdown - also need to test whether code rendering works nicely

Code:

{% highlight bash %}
$VAR1 = {
          'al.pha' => 'a',
          'beta' => 'b'
        };
{% endhighlight %}

Maths:

%% \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i}^{N} x_i $$
