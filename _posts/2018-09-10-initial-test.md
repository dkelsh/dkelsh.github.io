Hello, this is just a bit of text to test whether maths works within the markdown - also need to test whether code rendering works nicely

Code:

(% highlight python %}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

for i in range(10):
  print i**2
  
{% endhighlight %}

Maths:

%% \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i}^{N} x_i $$
