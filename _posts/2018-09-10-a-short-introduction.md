Data science can be described as a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. This field is becoming increasingly important as more data is being produced than ever before; we should take the opportunity to explore what the data can tell us. Using techniques such as machine learning we can use the large amounts of data generated to produce predictive models, these can be used by all manner of industries to improve their products, services, and the world around us.

The aim of this blog is to serve as a hub to share what I have learned through various courses/tutorials, as well as my own projects. I will write guides/tutorials on various data science/machine learning topics - explaining the theory as well as how it can be implemented to solve complex problems. I shall endeavour to explain as best I can, but due to the nature of the content, it may be best to work through the examples in order to gain a better understanding.
