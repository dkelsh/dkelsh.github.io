>I am an aerospace engineering student currently living in Manchester, UK  with a recently discovered interest in data science/machine learning. 

Although I have a variety of interests, these can really be distilled down to one thing: learning. I am currently focused on learning as much as I can through various courses and implementing this new-found knowledge in my own projects as a means to practice.
