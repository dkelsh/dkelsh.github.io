title: About
---

I am a third year aerospace engineering student currently living in Manchester, UK  with a recently discovered interest in data science/machine learning. 

Although I have a variety of interests, these can really be distilled down to one thing: learning. I am currently focused on learning as much as I can through a variety courses and implementing this new-found knowledge in my own projects as a means to practice.

This blog will act as a place to share some of what I have learned, as well as various projects that I am working on. Hopefully this will inspire some interest in others and provide some of the tools required to get started with machine learning!
